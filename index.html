        <div class="unity">
            <h2>Unity <i class="fa-solid fa-chevron-right chevron1"></i></h2>
            <p>Unity is one of the most popular and powerful platforms for developing games and interactive 3D and 2D
                content. It was first released in 2005 and has since grown significantly to become the choice of
                millions of developers worldwide. Unity enables the creation of games and applications for a wide range
                of platforms, including mobile devices, PCs, gaming consoles, and even virtual reality (VR) and
                augmented reality (AR) devices. One of Unityâ€™s main strengths is its user-friendly interface and
                flexibility. The development environment allows users to design scenes, add game objects, components,
                and scripts, as well as manage physics, animations, and audio interactions with ease. Programming in
                Unity is primarily done using the C# language, which is relatively easy to learn and powerful enough to
                implement complex game mechanics and systems.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="unreal ">
            <h2>Unreal Engine <i class="fa-solid fa-chevron-right chevron2"></i></h2>
            <p>Unreal Engine is a powerful and widely used game development engine created by Epic Games, first released
                in 1998. Over the years, it has evolved into one of the leading platforms for creating high-quality,
                visually stunning games and real-time 3D applications. Known for its advanced graphics capabilities,
                Unreal Engine is favored by both AAA studios and indie developers for building games across a variety of
                platforms including PC, consoles, mobile devices, and VR/AR systems.
                One of the defining features of Unreal Engine is its cutting-edge rendering technology. It supports
                photorealistic visuals with advanced lighting, shading, and post-processing effects such as dynamic
                global illumination, ray tracing, physically based rendering (PBR), and realistic reflections. These
                features allow developers to create immersive worlds with lifelike environments and characters. The
                engineâ€™s Blueprint visual scripting system is a unique aspect that enables developers and designers to
                create complex game logic without writing traditional code. This node-based interface is
                beginner-friendly and speeds up prototyping and development, though the engine also supports programming
                in C++ for more advanced customization and performance optimization.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="godot">
            <h2>Godot Engine <i class="fa-solid fa-chevron-right chevron3"></i></h2>
            <p>Godot Engine is a powerful, open-source, cross-platform game engine used to create both 2D and 3D games.
                Released under the MIT license, it offers a completely free environment with no royalties or licensing
                fees, making it ideal for indie developers, hobbyists, and professionals. Godot features a dedicated 2D
                engine optimized for pixel-perfect games and a robust 3D engine supporting modern rendering techniques
                such as physically based rendering (PBR), global illumination, and real-time shadows. Its unique scene
                system is based on nodes, allowing developers to build complex game scenes from simple, reusable
                components, which enhances flexibility and maintainability. The engine supports multiple scripting
                languages, primarily GDScript, a Python-like language designed for game development, but also supports
                C#, VisualScript, and native code integration via GDNative for performance-critical tasks. Games made
                with Godot can be exported to a wide variety of platforms including Windows, macOS, Linux, Android, iOS,
                and HTML5 with minimal configuration. Godotâ€™s lightweight and intuitive editor includes tools for
                animation, debugging, live editing, and profiling all in one interface. As an open-source project, it
                benefits from an active community that contributes features, plugins, and assets, leading to frequent
                updates and improvements. Godotâ€™s advantages include being free with no royalties, enabling fast
                prototyping due to its flexible editor and scripting, and allowing customization and extension by
                modifying the engine or creating plugins. It is especially known for its strong 2D support, as its 2D
                engine works independently of the 3D engine to provide high performance and specialized tools for 2D
                game creation</p>
        </div>
        <div class="cry">
            <h2> CryEngine<i class="fa-solid fa-chevron-right chevron4"></i></h2>
            <p>CryEngine is a powerful, high-performance game engine developed by Crytek, known for its advanced
                graphics capabilities and realistic rendering. It supports development of visually stunning 3D games
                with features like real-time global illumination, physically based rendering, advanced particle systems,
                and dynamic physics simulation. CryEngine provides a comprehensive suite of development tools including
                a visual editor, AI system, audio system, and animation tools, all designed to streamline game creation.
                It supports multiple platforms such as Windows, PlayStation, Xbox, and VR devices, enabling developers
                to deploy games across a broad range of hardware. The engine uses C++ as its primary programming
                language but also supports Lua scripting for rapid prototyping.</p>
